# ProceduralMap

Procedural map creation with C++ and SFML, using Perlin noise in an isometric view. For the moment, I have implemented the isometric view and a wave-like movement function as shown below. Currently, I'm working on the chunks system and later on loading and sharing chunks to optimize the program's efficiency.
